1.-The way to add comments on ruby (inline â€“ multiline)
	-Inline
		use <#> before a comment
		Example
		#Commnet about the code

	-Multiline
		use <=begin
			Comment
			about
			the
			code
			=end>

		Example
		=begin
		Comment
		about
		the
		code
		=end
2.-When you should use each type
	-<#> when you need comment about just one code line.

	-<=begin
	=end> when you need comment about all code or part of this, not one line. 

3.-Create and script using inline-multiline comments
	-Comments.rb
